# Fermentation-VAT-Monitoring-System-Pic18f45k22
•	Monitors the system continuously and acts when changes in parameters such as temperature and pressure are sensed. Motors(functioning indicated using LED’s) are operated by microchip to ensure optimum temperature and pressure is maintained  within the system. Analog values received from the sensors are converted to digital values and displayed on GUI in real time. 
•	Hardware & Software: PIC18f45k22, Breadboard, LED’s, MAX232, Pickit, MP Lab, Tera-Term and C-programming.
